// Package css provides Go bindings for the `CSS` domain
// (https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/CSS)
// in the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), version 1.3.
//
// This domain exposes CSS read/write operations. All CSS objects (stylesheets, rules, and styles)
// have an associated `id` used in subsequent operations on the related object. Each object type has
// a specific `id` structure, and those are not interchangeable between objects of different kinds.
// CSS objects can be loaded using the `get*ForNode()` calls (which accept a DOM node id). A client
// can also keep track of stylesheets via the `styleSheetAdded`/`styleSheetRemoved` events and
// subsequently load the required stylesheet contents using the `getStyleSheet[Text]()` methods.
//
// This domain is experimental!
//
